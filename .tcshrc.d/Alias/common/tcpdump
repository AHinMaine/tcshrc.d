# The tcpdump line is nice to see what traffic goes on the network
# -s 2000  means to grab all the packet (max is about 1500, but anyway..)
# -n  means do not resolve names. Makes it faster and lightweight.
# -i eth0  means only the Ethernet interface. In some distros, the loopback is
# shown too which clutters the output.
